# ntua-microcomputers
This is a repository for exercises done for the course Introduction to Micro-computers during the Spring Semester of the year 2019-2020 at ECE NTUA.  \
`Assembly` (of the 8085 and 8086 microcomputers), `AVR`, `Verilog` and a bit of `C` are all used in this repo.\
\
Credits to my partner Giannis Athanasiou(Github: John-Atha) for all the exercises.
